Auction Web App
So far, the web app can add, display all, display one using ID,
delete using ID, update likes and bids/highestBid using ID. I
have also added a feature for the dueDate of each bid, where a
counter is displayed showing how many days, minutes and seconds
are left to bid on an auction.

MongoDB with a mongoose schema is used to keep persistance within the app.
